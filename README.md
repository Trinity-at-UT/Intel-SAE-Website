# Intel-SAE-WebsiteWe introduce the Intel速 Simulation and Analysis Engine (Intel速 SAE) --- a framework for full-system instruction-level instrumentation of "ring 0" (privileged) and "ring 3" (user-level) code behavior on x86 platforms. When plugged-in to a Wind River速 Simics Virtual Platform, Intel速 SAE boots native operating systems (e.g. Linux and Windows, as well as Android), running unmodified binaries while facilitating flexible and customizable instruction-level instrumentation of everything executing on the CPU, i.e. BIOS, kernel, drivers and all kernel and user-space processes. Beyond its ability to instrument a single system, Intel SAE is capable of distributed node-to-node multi-system simulation and instrumentation, useful for analysis of enterprise-scale workloads, such as CloudSuite, Hadoop, Memcached etc.
